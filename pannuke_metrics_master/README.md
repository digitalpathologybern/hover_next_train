# Modified version of pannuke evaluation metrics

The pannuke evaluation metrics do not have a license, and therefore cannot easily be included in another repository.
To run PanNuke evaluation, please download the original code: https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/PanNuke-metrics
and paste ```run.py``` and ```utils.py``` into this folder.

We modified the script to be parallizable and a bit faster.
